<h3>Mango float is a popular dessert in the Philippines. It also goes by the names: Mango Royale or Crema de Mangga.
 A Filipino icebox cake made of graham crackers, all-purpose or whipped cream, sweetened condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is chilled for a few hours before serving,
 though it can also be frozen to give it an ice cream-like consistency. It could be the easiest, delicious no-bake dessert you could ever make</h3>
 <h5>Ingredients</h5>
	<ul>
<li>24-30 pieces of graham crackers</li>
<li>3 packs of 500ml all purpose cream</li>
<li>3 cans of 300ml sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>3 small medium ripe mangoes</li>
	</ul>

<h5>Instructions</h5>
	<ul>
<li>1. Chill the all-purpose cream the fridge overnight or in the freezer for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>2. Peel the skin off the mangoes. Cut away the sides (flesh) from the pit. Lay the mango halves flat-side down on a cutting board. Cut the flesh lengthwise into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
<li>3. Transfer chilled all-purpose cream in a large bowl. If you like it lighter and fluffier, whip it with a hand mixer until it doubles in volume.</li>
<li>4. Gradually add the sweetened condensed milk to the all-purpose cream until well blended</li>
<li>5. Line the bottom of a rectangular or square (8x8 or 6x6) glass dish (or something similar) with a layer Graham crackers then pour and spread 1/4 of the cream mixture on top of the crackers and then top with mango slices.</li>
<li>6. Repeat this process until 4 layers are formed, ending with the cream and mango slices on top. You can arrange the mango slices for the top in an overlapping manner for design.</li>
<li>7. Chill for at least 3-5 hours to set completely. You know it is ready when the Graham becomes soft and fluffy and no longer dry. You can also freeze it at this point before serving.</li>
