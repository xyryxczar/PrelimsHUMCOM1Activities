<!-- These are the ingredients of Spaghetti that helps to make it -->
<h3>Filipino spaghetti is a Filipino adaptation of the Italian spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. This version has a sweet tomato based sauce with lots of meat ingredients such as ground pork, luncheon meat, and hotdogs. 
It is often served during kid’s birthday parties along with some yummy fried chicken and cake. I had so many fond memories of Filipino-style spaghetti growing up it's amazing how obsessed I was with this pasta dish. My Family always make the best Spaghetti</h3>
